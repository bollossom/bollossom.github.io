I'm currently a Ph.D. student (from fall, 2022) at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) and a member of the [FudanNLP](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by A.P. [Xiaoqing Zheng](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/zhengxq/zh_CN/) and Prof. [Xuanjing Huang](https://xuanjing-huang.github.io/).

My research interests cover Brain-inspired Computing and Large Language Models. I am currently working on spiking neural networks for sequential tasks like natural language processing and time series analysis.

For more information, you may take a look at my publications.
