I'm currently a first-year Ph.D student at the Institue of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences With [Prof. Guoqi Li](https://casialiguoqi.github.io/) as my supervisor. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2024. My research interests include large-scale spiking neural networks, computer vision, and brain-inspired learning.
